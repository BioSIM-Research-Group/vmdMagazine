Beta-sheets

Beta-sheets are formed from the interaction of strands of amino acids disposed with their backbones in a plane conformation. beta-strands easily interact with neighbouring beta-strands through the C=O and Nâˆ’H groups of the backbone of the amino acids in the strand. The sidechains of the residues are placed in and out of the plane of the strand, perpendicular to the hydrogen bonds between the strands. The packing of the sidechains occurs more frequently between sidechains with opposite charges or with hydrophobic character.
